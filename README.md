Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of water channels found throughout the body, especially in the kidney, where they function in maintaining water homeostasis. The insertion of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the apical membrane of the kidney collecting duct drives water reabsorption back into the circulation. Many physiological processes are regulated depending on the time of day, including kidney function. For example, during the active period, the glomerular filtration rate and urine flow are significantly greater than during the inactive period when sleeping. We hypothesized that there is a diurnal pattern in urine and/or plasma osmolality and that this may reflect changes in kidney aquaporins in mice. Male and female C57BL/6J mice (10â€“11 weeks old) were studied in the middle of their active period (zeitgeber ZT18) or the middle of their inactive period (ZT6). Urine and plasma osmolality were significantly higher at ZT18 in both sexes. Kidney mRNA expression showed diurnal differences in Aqp1 in males and Aqp3 in both sexes. However, the kidney protein abundance and localization of AQP1, AQP2, and AQP3 exhibited no diurnal variation. In female mice, AQP4 protein abundance was greater at ZT18 than ZT6. Compared to male mice, female mice had significantly greater kidney AQP1, AQP2, and AQP4 abundance in both ZT6 and ZT18. Thus, during the middle of the active period, when mice are eating and drinking, plasma and urine osmolality are significantly higher, but kidney AQP abundance and localization may not explain this physiological diurnal variability.   <br>
